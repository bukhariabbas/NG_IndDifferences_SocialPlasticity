# NG_IndDifferences_SocialPlasticity
  Individuals differ in their display of social behavior. For instance, male sticklebacks respond differently when presented with a challenging environment and mount a varying levels of aggressive responses. Also they differ in the amount of care they provide to their children (measured in terms of fanning or spending time in their nest). Recently studies have quantified the neurogenomic response to social plasticity in number of animal species however our understanding of how intra-individual plasticity is factored in with developmental plasticity in the neurogenomic response to social environment is still lacking. How genetics and development interact at molecular level can help better understand both the ultimate and the proximate basis of social behavior. 
  This directory contains scripts associated with our upcoming manuscript where we explore the role of individual differences neurogenomic response to social plasticity. Here we adds to our two recent studies (Bukhari et al., 2017 &amp; Bukhari et al., 2019), and explores the genic basis of individual differences in social plasticity especially when presented with contrasting social interactions.
